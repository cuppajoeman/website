title: getting stuff done
---

<p>
    Over the years, I've noticed a few things that help me get things done.
</p>

<h2>seeding</h2>

<p>
    Seeding is the practice of visualizing and thinking about events that are within your control to happen (within a certain time frame) before you want them to happen. I find it most useful for events that you want to turn into habits but are not yet habits.
</p>

<p>
    I personally use this for time frames that are within 7 hours before the event you want to happen. For example I am trying to get back into the habit of visiting the gym, but I'm not quite there; on some days I might not be feeling it and I might just not want to go.
</p>

<p>
    If we approach this situation without seeding, then as time passes through the day I might only consider going to the gym at one point, at this point in time, I consider the event weigh if I should go, at this point in time it's easy for me to decide not to go, I don't have any built up thoughts about why I might want to go and it seems just like a quick decision.
</p>

<p>
    With seeding you've already decided that you want to go to the gym from some time between 7 to 9pm and so as that time approaches your mind recalls that you wanted to go to the gym before this time, and there is already some mental power in your memory holding information about going to the gym, now when you make the decision to go, it's easier because you've already decided that you want to do earlier on, and so making the decision is just agreeing with yourself, which is easier than making a decision.
</p>

<h2>mental sway</h2>

<p>
    Throughout your day you'll find that your mind will change what it wants to do, some of this has to do with random events that occur throughout the day and some of it physical. For example if I came up to you right before you went to sleep and said, hey let's go to the gym, then you'd probably let me know that now is not a good time.
</p>

<p>
    Maybe you planned on going to the gym at 7 to 9, but a friend randomly appeared at your door and wanted to chat and so you abandoned your plans for the gym.
</p>

<p>
    Your mind can really only focus on one thing with it's full power at a time, so if you start doing something different, your mind will lower the priority of the seeded idea, so to keep the priority of the event you must re-seed it as you go through different events. This priority shifting process is what I call mental sway, and being aware of it helps you achieve your goals.
</p>

<p>
    The process of changing your mental priority is the hardest part, but once you're doing the task it's easy to continue doing it. Training your ability to change priorty like this is a skill that can be obtained over time.
</p>

<h2>managing interrupts</h2>

<p>
    When an event has your highest mental priority, but you've just become aware of the fact that the mental priority will be interrupted by another event, you need to start winding down the priority and "saving" it so that you can reload it back in quickly and bring it back up to priority.
</p>

<p>
    One way to manage interupts is if you have enough time is to store what you're currently doing lasting medium.
</p>

<h2>regenerating priority</h2>
<p>
    When you come back after an interupt you might not want to continue with the event that was interupted, this is because you're unable to rebuild the mental state you were in when you had this event at the priority
</p>


<h2>using others</h2>
