    In this article I'll talk about two ideas in learning and how they can be used to complement each other.
</p>

<h2>Gettting Stuck</h2>
<p>
    In the past I always used to get stuck and not continue until I fully understand what was in my way. The benefits of this were that I fully understood everything that I knew about.
</p>

<h2>Moving On</h2>
<p>
    The second approach is that after you've gotten stuck for a period of time on something you move on to something new, this is good because it means that you can learn more things in a shorter period of time, possibly by learning more content this gives you insight into your previous problem.
</p>

<h2>Knowing When to do What</h2>
<p>
    Getting stuck and moving on are both important things to master, you have to use them dynamically and based on the context. For example if the idea is fundamental to the coming materials, and is a building block, then it will probably be worth getting stuck on. On the other hand, if the problem is not fundamental then you can probably move on from it. Just never forget to come back.
</p>

<p>
    At the end of the day, it's going to be your own will power that will allow you to decide when to switch from one to the other, your will power will control it all.
