title: minimal phone usage
---

<p>
    In this article I'll recall my experiences with using a phone and why I believe it's beneficial to reduce the amount of time you can spend on it.
</p>

<h2>what is a phone</h2>

<p>
    Nowadays a phone is no longer just a telephone. A phone is a computer that has an operating system that allows you to install 3rd party applications, utilize a camera, gps services, connect to the internet, stream movies, play games, text others, etc...
</p>

<p>
    This makes a phone into a sort of swiss army knife that allows you to do many things all stored in one place. Initially this seems like a good thing, but I'll explain why it actually isn't.
</p>

<h2>isolation</h2>

<p>
    Upon initial glance having a phone in your pocket all the time seems like a great advantage, if you see something interesting, then you simply pull out your phone and take a picture of it, if you want to do a quick calculation simply use the calculator app, if you want to stay organized use the calendar app, if you want to listen to a song pull out the music app. The result of this is isolation
</p>

<p>
    Let's start with the first example of using your phone as a camera, while this seems harmless this robs you of a few things, firstly the experience of photography, the average phone user will probably never set out on an expedition to go and just take photos, the reason why is because they never consider their phone as just a camera.
</p>

<p>
    When you have a device that is just a camera, then it has one purpose, if you walk out of your home with a camera, you will be taking pictures. This mindset change is what really allows you to explore your interests, by walking out of your house with a camera you're opening yourself up to have conversations with other camera users, you're focusing all your attention towards photography and obtaining a new skill.
</p>

<p>
    On the other hand, leaving your home with a phone, really means nothing, you may use the camera or you may not, most likely no one is going to approach you and ask you meaningful questions about your phone.
</p>

<p>
    This idea applies to pretty much everything on a phone, for example if you purchased a record player you could invite your friends over to expereience it and explore new music, alternatively you an just have your phone recommend you new songs.
</p>

<p>
    As my concluding remarks, using a phone is like walking around with a swiss army knife that can do anything you want and the experience of doing any one task with a phone is much less rewarding then willingly taking the time to do that task directly and isolates you from others.
</p>

<h2>input vs output</h2>

<p>
    When you interact with something it is usually in the form of creating or consuming, for example if you listen to someone play music, you are listening to someone else create something so you are the consumer and they are the creator.
</p>

<p>
    Consuming and creating have to be balanced to life a healthy lifestyle, for example if you just ate a lot of food and never used the energy it gave you, then you would become fat and unhealthy.
</p>

<p>
    For some reason many of the 3rd party applications or even ones that come installed on the phone force the user into an unhealthy balance of mainly consuming with a minimal amount of creation. For example many phones now have youtube pre-installed on the phone, the average user who uses youtube will simply just watch videos, and most likely never create new videos. Instagram users mainly scroll forever on a page, and sometimes post an image.
</p>

<p>
    All of these apps don't have your best interests at mind, they want to capture your attention for as much time as they can and then show you things that they think are good for you. They have groups of people who are paid literally to make this expereience as addicting as possible to you so that you don't leave.
</p>

<p>
    The more you use these 3rd party applications, the better you get at consuming new paths are burned into your brain that reward you for doing this, meanwhile the paths for creation are not being exercised.
</p>

<h2>what you're shown</h2>

<p>
    The type of content shown on these apps are usually highlights, so that you get an unhealthy representation of what they are actually doing in their life, whereas simply just talking to these people in real life would uncover much more rich information, and you would develop a new acquaintance.
</p>

<p>
    On these apps there is usually an idea of a friendship and of liking something, although communicating with someone purely digitally is not the same as knowing someone in real life, 10 days of talking to someone in real life is worth 100 days of online friendship.
</p>

<h2>sleep effects</h2>

<p>
    Over time most phone users eventually start bringing their phones into bed with them, what this means is that before you sleep you have a device capable of showing you anything for an indefinite period of time, this usally equates to most people using their phone before they sleep from anywhere up to 15 mins to 2 hours. This mixing of beds and phones is really bad, as it can easily become a habit and shaves off extra time for sleeping that you would have had otherwise.
</p>

<p>
    It also goes against the general principle we are building up, which is when possible keep your focus on one thing only and do it well, in this case we are mixing sleeping and phone usage.
</p>

<p>
    Additionally if you fall alseep with your phone, then most likely you'll wake up with your phone, and now the question is whether you want to wake up instantly or if you want to look at your phone for some instant reward. If you use your phone the moment you wake up you are prolonging the time it takes for you to get to the next task, this is a common pattern with phone usage, it bogs you down and slows you down from getting what you want to do done.
</p>

<h2>human computer interaction</h2>

<p>
    The way in which you interact with your phone is also sub-optimal, it uses a touch screen, and most of the time they way you will interact with your phone is through touching a virtual keyboard with your fingers. This method of interaction is imprecise and slow when compared to a real computer keyboard. On average I would say most can type 20-25wpm on a phone making it even harder to write or create anything of use on it.
</p>

<p>
    With the current way you interact with a phone and the dimensions of it's screen, it's mainly designed for reading small bodies of text and the creation of small textual content, if you have hopes of doing anything more significant then you will have to put in much more effort to make it work.
</p>

<p>
    Games or expereiences developed with it are usually designed so that they can be operated only with one or two fingers, decreasing the complexity of any application on the phone.
</p>

<h2>breaking the cycle</h2>

<p>
    With all this being said, it's pretty easy to see why many people have a dependence on their phones, it acts as a swiss army knife that allows you to do almost anything at your finger tips, the third party applicaitons are addicitive and designed to get you hooked, you might be using your phone every night before you sleep and the moment you wake up. So how can you get this under control.
</p>

<h3>sleep</h3>
<details>

    <p>
        Let's start by attacking the usage of the phone in the bed. Let's put ourselves in the shoes of someone who is addicted to their phone and uses it before they sleep every night, if we think about this there is a point in time in which the user decides that sleeping is more of a priority than to continue looking at their phone and then they fall asleep.
    </p>

    <p>
        The driving factor in the above paragraph is tiredness, if you are extremely tired then you will not have the urge to use your phone because sleeping is more important to you at that moment. This is tractable; you already believe that sleep is more important than your phone, then we should be able to pull this back to make any sense of tiredness more important than your phone.
    </p>

    <p>
        One method to do this is to work out or to do exercise during the day, by doing this it will make you much more tired when you get into bed as your body physically needs the sleep in order to rebuild itself for the next day. Alternatively you could do more social things or mentally challenging things during the day which will make your brain more tired when you get to bed.
    </p>

    <p>
        Though the best thing if you can is to not put your phone elsewhere before you go to bed, and do it way before you're ever tired, when your tired it will be easy to fall in to your phone desires, so do it when your mentality is strong and you are serious about not using your phone, or ask someone else close to you to hold onto your phone.
    </p>

    <p>
        The experience of waking up naturally without a phone next to you is very rewarding, try doing this on a day that you don't have to wake up at a particlar hour and then make sure there are no clocks nearby either, this natural wake up is great as you get up when you feel awake enough to do so. We have certain times baked into our minds which tell us oh, we're waking up late or we're waking up early which then inform us to sleep further or wake up now, freeing yourself from this makes you feel great.

<h3>bad phone</h3>

    <p>
        If you understand and agree with the reasons discussed above about why your phone usage might be detrimental, then you should try to enforce that thought in your head more often, try to become self aware of what you're doing on your phone and the effects it may have.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you can try to own a "bad phone", for this I recommend owning an android phone (as they tend to last longer), and try to keep it for more than 3 years, at this point your phone cannot really run the latest and greatest applications and games and it will not really run super smoothly anymore and maybe there are cracks in the screen. This will make your experience using the phone even worse, which will make you less likely to use the phone often, in this sense owning a bad phone is good.
