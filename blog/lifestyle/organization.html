    How I stay organized.
</p>

<h2>why get organized</h2>
<p>
    Getting organized is a really good skill to have, and requires you to be introspective, the skill of being able to analyze yourself and improve upon yourself is a very fundamental skill and keeps yourself on-track with your own personal goals.
</p>

<p>
    The first thing you should do is to find what level of organization suits you. One of my first attempts at getting organized was to structure my day, I was inspired by how school gives you a schedule and blocks out sections of time for class. I set out time for a shower, breakfast, study time exercise time, relax time, etc...
</p>

<h2>time</h2>

<p>
    One thing you can organize is your time, this relates to being aware of how your time is spent and how you use it effectively for your own personal goals.
</p>

<h3>time blocking</h3>

<p>
    This type of organization can managed through apps like google calendar that allow you to speify time windows for certain tasks.
</p>

<p>
    While following this structure it worked for a while, but eventually I got to a point where I had messed up and missed one of my time blocks for a certain task, that had thrown off everything else I had planned for the day and was the first instance of me starting to despise the system I had built for myself. Over time I realized that when I missed something or something didn't go to plan, that I felt back because I wasn't following the structure I had laid out.
</p>

<p>
    This eventually culminated to a point where I completely gave up on my schedule. Personally I believe that the reason why this happened was for me my life was not simply a static straightforward situation that could be planned out before hand, I couldn't simply force my time within static blocks.
</p>

<h3>time blocking multi-person events</h3>

<p>
    Instead of using time blocking for all of my events, I decided to only use time blocking for events that involve multiple people. This makes sense because since different people all do things at different times, the only real way to make sure you can do a task is to decide together on a time for the event.
</p>

<p>
    Examples:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>doctors appointments</li>
    <li>classes</li>
    <li>meetings</li>
</ul>

<h2>staying dynamic</h2>
<p>
    In life I believe that experiencing new things that you might not have tried before is a good way to learn new things and to have new experiences. A big example for me was going to check out universities with my mom before committing to one, personally I woulnd't have done this, but I was convinced to do otherwise, while we stayed in one of the hotels there was a guitar on the wall, which I tried playing (even though I had no clue of how to play it) due to that I now play guitar for fun and it has brought me lots of joy.
</p>

<p>
    Due to my experiences with trying new things, I believe it's important to stay dynamic and not always do what you have planned for yourself. So I also believe that if you're organizing/structuring yourself, but an opportunity arises to break out of that organization even for a minute, then I recommend trying it. You don't have to do this for every opportunity that arises, but also don't ignore every opportunity either, you might learn something new.
