title: portable gaming setup
---

<p>
    If you're travelling frequently, gaming can become difficult, especially if you're used to gaming on a desktop computer. In this article I'll give some tips to reconstruct such a setup in a portable manner
</p>

<h2>laptop</h2>

<p>
    The first thing that will help is getting a laptop, depending on the types of games you enjoy should direct you. For me I chose a laptop with a decent size screen with a good refresh rate and io.
</p>

<h2>external requirements</h2>

<ul>
    <li>a flat surface such as a table</li>
    <li>a chair</li>
</ul>

<h2>optional requirements</h2>

<ul>
    <li>a router</li>
</ul>

<h2>peripherals</h2>

<p>
    The peripherials of my choice is a gaming mouse, a mouse pad, an external keyboard and ear-buds.
</p>

<h2>ergonomics</h2>

<p>
    The main thing is getting the table and chair set up to the right height for gaming, once you have that use the laptop stand to get the screen to the right height

<h2>backpack</h2>

<p>
    In order to move your gear, I recommend a laptop backpack
