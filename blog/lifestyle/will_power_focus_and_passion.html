title: will power, focus, passion in a capitalist society

<p>
    Personally I find these three ideas to be the most important in life.

TODO: economy, society, resources, etc...

<h2>passion</h2>
<p>
   The type of passion I'll be speaking about here is passion for a domain or particular thing in life

    Passion for something usually feels like something innate, while this can be true in some cases, I've personally found that the things I am passionate for are not simply feelings I was born with but rather, ideas/concepts/things that over time I have obtained a particular liking to.
