        <h2>motivation</h2>

        <p>
            When I first found out about mathlib, I found it difficult to find theorems that I was interested in,
            I wanted to find some elementary facts about natural numbers after completing the natural number game.
        </p>

        It was this theorem
        <pre>
            <code>
@[protected, simp]
theorem nat.zero_eq_mul {a b : ℕ} :
0 = a * b ↔ a = 0 ∨ b = 0
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            Since I had thought this had to do with number theory I looked under the number theory section in mathlib, after
            lots of searching I realized it wasn't there. Instead it was in data.nat.basic, and upon further discussion,
            I learned by talking to someone else that data is where basic facts are stored.
        </p>

        <p>
            Due to some of the confusion I've had with mathlib, I decided to start this page where we explain the structure.
            This page can added to

        <h2>naming conventions</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b>nat</b> - natural numbers</li>
            <li><b>fun</b> - function</li>
            <li><b>int</b> - integers</li>
            <li><b>zmod</b> - integers mod n</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>where to look</h2>

        <h3>elementary results</h3>
        <p>If you are looking for an elementary result, start your search in <b>data</b>, </p>
