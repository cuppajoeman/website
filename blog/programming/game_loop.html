title: game loop
---

<p>
  There are many articles on game loops, many require extra text to explain how it works. In this article I would like to produce self descriptive code with good naming conventions and comments that stand on their own without extra documentation.
</p>

<p>
  Before we get started, make sure you can at least understand the basics of c++ code, also read <a href="https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/">Glen's article</a> on this topic first.

#include <cstdlib>
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>

/* game loop
 *
 * description:
 * 		a game loop that updates the game state at fixed time intervals while also rendering as fast as possible.
 *
 * remarks:
 * 		all time units are seconds
 *
 * design:
 * 		the fundamental idea is that during the previous iteration (PI) time has passed. Now during the current iteration (CI),
 * 		based on the PI's duration, we retroactively apply updates until we have "caught up" our state.
 *
 * 		right before a new iteration commences PI becomes CI, and we are now in the new CI.
