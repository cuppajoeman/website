<p>A collection of information that I find useful for working with godot</p>

<h2>development on older computer</h2>

<p>
    On older computers we can still develop with godot. On an older computer I usually like to run a lightweight linux distribution, like manjaro with xfce. To keep godot up to date I install steam and install godot through that, when you launch godot it may complain about your graphics card being really old, in that case add <code>--rendering-driver opengl3</code> to the launch options for godot.
