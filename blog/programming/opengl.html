<p>
    This will document how I learned opengl for free using the internet.
</p>

<p>
    I started off by reading from the website opengl, it starts with including glfw into a c program, which in order to do you have to understand how to compile and link libraries into your own c programs, for this I learned about cmake using their official tutorial, once I finished the tutorial I was able to use glfw and create a basic window.

<p>
    After creating a basic window I followed along with learnopengl until I could create the basic triangle, glfw also has a good reference for how to do it
