title: creating a directory structure
---

<p>
    Suppose we have a directory that contains the following folders
</p>

<pre>
    a
        b
            c
                d
                e
                f
                    g
                    h
                    i
</pre>

<p>
    And we'd like to represent this as the dictionary: <code>{'': {'a': {'b': {'c': {'e': {}, 'd': {}, 'f': {'i': {}, 'h': {}, 'g': {}}}}}}}</code>
</p>

<p>
    Then the following code snippet can be modified to your use case. It's use case is to create a directory structure like above while walking the filesystem in the <code>html</code> directory located outside of the directory that the script is in.
</p>

<pre>
    <code class="language-python">
import os
import sys
from os import walk

script_directory = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
os.chdir("../html")
html_directory = os.getcwd()

directory_structure = {}

for dir_path, dirs, file_names in walk(html_directory):
    for name in file_names:
        full_path = os.path.join(dir_path, name)
        is_html_file = name[-4:] == "html"
        if is_html_file:
            relative_path = os.path.relpath(full_path)

            sub_directory = directory_structure

            for sub_path in relative_path.split("\\"):
                sub_directory = sub_directory.setdefault(sub_path, {})

    </code>

</pre>

<p>
    Note that we're taking full advantage of setdefault to create subdirectories, and refreshing the value of <code>sub_directory</code> to the latest dictionary. See <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_setdefault.asp">setdefault</a> for more information
</p>
