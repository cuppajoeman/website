  Embrace extend extinguish describes a strategy that lucrative companies employ to take over certain domains. Today we'll be discussing how this relates to programming, and what you can do to combat it.

<h2>terminology</h2>
<ul>
  <li>lucrative company (l.c.): a company that values money over the service and customers that use the provided service</li>
</ul>

  This article follows a similar thread to other ideas on this website, which is to elevate the individual in the world of technology. If you were to open up someone's phone, you'd probably find at least one or two of the common culprits: youtube, facebook, instagram, snapchat, tiktok.
</p>

<p>
  The general reason why this lowers the power of the individual in the world of technology is that by using these services for content creation, communication and just as a "catch all" because you're bored, you're investing more and more into these companies and not on individuals.

<p>
  Another big issue is that most people don't read user agreements, they're simply just something in the way of getting into the application. This is a huge issue because people end up investing their time and money into something to which they have no idea what they might do now or in the future, and for the most part large lucrative companies want to make their agreements as beneficial for them as possible.
</p>

<p>
  Barring user agreements, large companies which are composed of many people seem less like communities but more like large untouchable objects that can only be interacted with in the way that they allow you to. How hard would it be to just talk to someone high up at one of these companies and just talk to them as a regular person and for them to share their vision with you, it's simply just not possible.
</p>

<p>
  An easy, naive solution might be to simply delete any applications that come from large lucrative companies, but you will most likely realize that this is not the solution, as if you want to seriously take this on you'll most likely lose connections, potential audience and the ability to communicate with many people. For example, for a while I decided not to use facebook messenger for a while, and I found it really hard to communicate with others online at school because that was the main form of communication used at my school.
</p>

<p>
  So how do we actually tackle this issue while also still being able to interact with people who only use L.C. software. I'll take a look at the usage of instagram as a specific example, so let's assume you have an instagram account to which you post content to. As you may know instagram allows you to post collections of images, videos.
