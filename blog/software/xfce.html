<h2>sharing a computer with others</h2>
<p>
    While working on your own is fine, I do find myeslf with other people who eventually end up using my computer, to this end I like xfce because it has enough similarities with the windows and mac operating systems that pretty much anyone can use it. This is similar to the reasoning as to why I use querty over colemaks and dvorjak

<h2>grab key</h2>
<p>
    The key used to grab the window is usually alt, there are two problems with this in that the alt key is used in various prgroams to allow you to select options through a gui menu without moving your mouse, which is quite useful, so therefore I recommand you remap this key through the window manager tweaks program, personally I've remapped it to the super key
</p>

<h2>using transparent windows</h2>
<p>
    before you can use this you have to go into the window manager tweaks section and deselect Use mouse wheel on title bar to roll up the window.
