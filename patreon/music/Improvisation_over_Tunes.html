    <h1 class="text_center">Improvisation over Tunes</h1>

    <p>
        Improvising over tunes is something you can do after you're able to read the changes in real time.
    </p>

    <p>
        To define what improvisation is, is quite difficult so we'll start with what a beginner might do to improvise
        over a tune.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's say that we're looking at our song again:
    </p>

    <p>
        They know that it's in the key of 5* major but they're not too good at reading the changes, so they play notes
        within the 5* major scale when they're improvising.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is fine, but there is a loss of information and the player is not aware of all the harmonic information
        that is occuring.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you have the ability of what the changes are you can still use the key that the piece is in for reference
        but now you're able to know how the harmony is changing through the chord changes, with this information you
        might make lines which use notes from those chords or that don't, but the key thing is that you're actually
        aware of the underlying harmonic information so the choices you make are purposeful rather than accidental.
    </p>

    <p>
        To sum up improvisation is the ability to consider what is happening at any moment and make new decisions which
        might be unexpected or expected and execute them. (what might differentiate us from machines)
    </p>


    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Structure</h2></div>

    <p>
        One of the most prevalent ways to improvise is by using structure, one structure that we've already mentioned is
        playing notes which "follow" the changes. Another structure could be to take some intervallic pattern and move
        it through the changes so the notes match the changes, but the structure stays the same the whole time.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another type of structure could be the lack of structure, so play notes which aren't expected or with odd
        rhythms, any idea that you have usually falls into a type of structure and being able to execute these ideas and
        come up with them is what will make you a good improviser.
