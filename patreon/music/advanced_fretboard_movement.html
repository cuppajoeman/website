    <h1 class="text_center">Advanced Fretboard Movement</h1>

    <p>
        As you get more comfortable with the fretboard it's easy to do movements which reduce hand movement by staying
        in a single position, this causes bias in your playing. In this article we'll talk about things that will help
        reduce this bias.
    </p>

        <h2 class="line_text">Traversing ai Collections</h2></div>

    <p>
        Let's say we are playing in 6* harmonic minor, so we're using the ai collection 0 2 3 5 7 8 11 0. Restricting
        ourselves to those ais then as we play anything in some way we are traversing that ai collection.
    </p>

    <p>
        Becoming aware of how you traverse is quite useful, since you can add structure or lack of structure to your
        movement.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, lets say we want to traverse the collection in a linear manner, we could simply do 0 2 3 5 7 8 11
        0, now let's traverse it in a jumping manner, so we have 0 3, 2 5, 3 7, 5 8, 7 11, 8 0, 11 2, 0, we could also
        increase the jump size to be 0 5, 2 7, 3 8, 5 11, 7 0, 8 2, 11 3, 0.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you play that you'll see that they give off an enjoyable sound as there is a lot of structure in the way
        you're playing through the ai collection. By being aware of what you're doing to traverse these collections you
        can bring certain feelings to your playing.
    </p>

    <p>
        By practicing these movements your movement along the fretboard will improve a lot and you won't go up and down
        ai collections linearly as much.
    </p>

        <h2 class="line_text">Diagonals</h2></div>

    <p>
        A great way to get up and down the neck without just moving your whole hand there at once is to do it
        incrementally.
    </p>

    <p>
        One idea for getting up the neck is to move diagonally up it. When you move like this you're forcing your hand
        out of a position to a new one and figuring out how you can connect between them.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example let's say with the harmonic minor example, so we have the ai collection 0 2 3 5 7 8 11 0, and you're
        starting on 3 low on the neck. Since we've decided to move diagonally that means that when we move we are going
        to be adding at least 7 to our current ai each time, so first lets do some analysis on what we can do to stay
        within the harmonic minor while adding at least 7 each time.
    </p>

    <p>
        3 + 8 = 11, 11 + 8 = 7, 7 + 7 = 2, 2 + 9 = 11. Meaning that if we start on three and then go up in jumps of 8 8
        7 2 we'll have gone up the neck and also stayed within the harmonic minor the whole time. In terms of the
        fretboard, we can get these larger intervals by moving over one string and then 2 to 4 frets upward.
    </p>

    <p>
        Diagonal movement is a good medium between direct vertical movement and horizontal and being comfortable with
        this type of movement will aid you in moving on the fretboard.
    </p>

        <h2 class="line_text">Using Fret Numbers</h2></div>

    <p>
        Fret numbers (e.g. the 5th fret) are especially useful for vertical movement. The reason why its useful is that
        it allows us to break out of vertical movement habits that have been gained because we don't like moving our
        hand so much, for moving a great distance vertically is probably less easy for you to do than a step of 2 or 3.

    </p>

    <p>
        Sticking to harmonic again and assuming we have a finger on 8 on the 3rd fret, then making a great leap up the
        neck may be frightening, but we'll make it easy. Since an increase in one by the fret number increases our ai by
        one as well, then moving up say 8 frets also adds 8 to our current note, but how do we know which fret is 8 up
        from our current?
    </p>

    <p>
        Well all we have to do is take our current fret number which is 3 and add 8 to it which gives us the 11th fret.
        This type of calculation is useful for when you want to move up a lot and you don't have the muscle memory yet
        for moving up that much.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note: Talking about the 18th fret seems harder than talking about the 6th fret an octave up, especially since
        the second octave on the guitar is identical to the first. Thinking like this also allows us to use tricks that
        we've built up in the past, so now 10 frets up from the 5th fret is just 5 - 2 = 3 (using the equivalent in the
        cyclic number system) so it's the 3rd fret in the second octave.
    </p>

        <h2 class="line_text">Harmonics</h2></div>

    <p>
        Harmonics are found on the 12th fret (0th fret of the second octave) of the guitar. It represents the midpoint
        of the nut and the bridge and therefore the part of the string which vibrates. Every note we play rings all
        harmonics above it, and by pressing in the middle of the string it deadens the original note leaving only the
        harmonics which have fixed points in the center of the string to ring.
    </p>

    <p>
        The sound produced by a harmonic is quite nice and has a certain ethereal feeling to it. The harmonic of a
        string firstly represents the note which is associated with that string, so if we play the harmonic of the
        lowest string it still represents 4*. But it also represents the note which is 7 steps above it, and so it can
        be played in place of 11*, to understand why read the article on harmonics.
    </p>

    <p>
        So therefore on the fretboard, whenever you're going to play an open string, you can use the harmonic by
        pressing lightly on the twelfth fret to get the same note with an airy feeling.
    </p>

        <h2 class="line_text">Artificial Harmonics</h2></div>

    <p>
        Artificial Harmonics are real harmonics, but are produced in a manner which is not by playing the string
        directly at one of the harmonic nodes. If we were fretting a note, we can think of the lenght of the string
        we're about to vibrate being reduced to the length between the bridge and this fret, and therefore the halfway
        point of the string is now in a new location.
    </p>

    <p>
        If we press lightly on that location with our plucking hand and pluck underneath that with another finger we can
        also get harmonics again. To fully understand that, watch <a

        <h2 class="line_text">Tapping</h2></div>

    <p>
        Tapping is a method of playing the guitar where you don't sound the note by using your plucking hand, but
        instead the force of your finger hitting the fret rings the note itself. When trying to learn this you should
        probably use an electric guitar which has a lot of gain so it's loud.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once you've figured out how to tap, you can also tap with both hands and play chords and lines which would be
        impossible with just one.
    </p>

    <p>
        Learn the technique by watching videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0YC2g4Av84">tapping</a>
