    <p>
        In our previous lesson we touched on considering notes with respect to some anchor note, for example if our
        anchor note was 8* (Ab) then the note 9* would be considered as 1. Whenever we specify a note like this, it
        will be called an anchor interval and no asterisk will be written.
    </p>

    <p>
        More explicitly an anchor interval of a note is the interval between the anchor note and the note we're
        considering. We'll go into what this means throughout this article.
    </p>

    <p>
        You might have noticed that when we set our anchor note to be 11*, that every note's anchor
        interval became one more than it's actual number, for example 3* was 4 and 9* was 10. This was no mere
        coincidence, in this lesson we will explore what's actually going on here.
    </p>

    <p>
        For a new example, let's set our anchor note to be 2* (D) and let's consider notes with respect to that
        anchor note. If we consider 4*, we can see that that's 2 up from 2*, so it's interval with respect to the
        anchor note would be 2.
    </p>

    <p>
        But the question we really just answered was, which number do we add to 2* to get to 4*, and that number is
        2. In a different way our question was just 2* + x = 4*, which can be rearranged to be x = 4* - 2* which is
        equal to 2.
    </p>

    <p>
        Due to this we have gained a method to determine the interval between any two notes, so given a note X* and
        a note Y*, the interval from X* to Y* is Y - X.
    </p>

    <p>
        Though we might ponder the following question, what is the interval from 2* to 0*, based on the above
        examples, it might be easy to say -2, but another way to think about it is that if you add 9 to 2* you would
        get 11*, and since our system of notes repeats (... 9* 10* 11* 0* 1* 2* 3* 4* 5* 6* 7* 8* 9* 10* 11* 0* 1*
        2* ...), then we can see going one more step leads us to 0. So due to that, we can say that the interval
        from 2* to 0* is 10. Since if we add 10 to 2*, we get to 0*.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because of the above, we never have to use negative numbers if we don't want to. So the interval from 9* to
        0* could be thought of 3 instead of -9. So when we talk about intervals we will always consider the positive
        version.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now that we've discussed some of the fundamental properties about anchor intervals, we can discuss how we can
        determine any anchor interval. Let's start with a specific example, and then come up with the general method.
    </p>

    <p>
        So let's say our anchor note is set as 8* and our note is 6*, then since the interval from 8* to 6* is -2 or
        10, then 6*'s anchor interval is 10.
    </p>

    <p>
        So given an anchor note of Y* and a note of X*, then we take the positive version of Y* - X* as the anchor
        interval.
    </p>


    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Computing Anchor Intervals efficiently</h2></div>

    <p>
        First let's repeat the method we already know and see if we can improve it. Our current method is that we take
        the anchor note X* and the other note we're considering Y*. Our goal is to figure out what the anchor interval
        of that note is, since we know that the anchor interval is defined as the interval between the anchor note and
        the other note, then all we have to do is figure out what Y - X is and we have our anchor interval.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the components of the above process which can be easier is if we could make X as small as possible so
        that when we subtract it from Y we don't have to "move" very much. The way we can minimize this movement is by
        using certain equivalent numbers to Y that are "smaller".
    </p>

    <p>
        If we consider the number 9, we know that it's equivalent to -3 in the system, but also we can see that -3 uses
        the number 3 which is smaller than 9. If you go back to the table found in the article about "Numbers in a
        Cyclic System", then you'll see that for any number there is always a small version of it. To sum that up we can
        see this table
    </p>

    <table class="center">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Number</th>
            <th>Equivalent</th>
            <th>Small Representation</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>0<br></td>
            <td>-0</td>
            <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>-11<br></td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>-10</td>
            <td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>-9<br></td>
            <td>3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>-8</td>
            <td>4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>-7</td>
            <td>5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>-6</td>
            <td>6</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>7</td>
            <td>-5</td>
            <td>-5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>8</td>
            <td>-4</td>
            <td>-4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>9</td>
            <td>-3</td>
            <td>-3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>10</td>
            <td>-2</td>
            <td>-2<br></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>11</td>
            <td>-1</td>
            <td>-1</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
        So for example if our anchor note was 8* and our other note was 2* then instead of computing 2 - 8 which
        involves a larger jump, since 8 is the same as -4 in our system we could compute 2 - (-4) = 2 + 4 = 6.
    </p>

    <h3>The Process</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Take your anchor note and consider the smallest representation of that number. For example if my anchor note
            was 8*, then I would be thinking of the number -4.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now take your other note and subtract the small representation of the anchor note from your note, the result
            is the anchor interval.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Now that you have the process go train on the anchor interval trainer under the web applications until you are
        fast.
