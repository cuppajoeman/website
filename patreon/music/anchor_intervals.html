        <p>
            In our previous lesson we touched on considering notes with respect to some anchor note, for example if our
            anchor note was 8* (Ab) then the note 9* would be considered as 1. Whenever we specify a note like this, it
            will be called an anchor interval and no asterisk will be written.
        </p>

        <p>
            More explicitly an anchor interval of a note is the interval between the anchor note and the note we're 
            considering. We'll go into what this means throughout this article.
        </p>

        <p>
            You might have noticed that when we set our anchor note to be 11*, that every note's anchor
            interval became one more than it's actual number, for example 3* was 4 and 9* was 10. This was no mere
            coincidence, in this lesson we will explore what's actually going on here.
        </p>

        <p>
            For a new example, let's set our anchor note to be 2* (D) and let's consider notes with respect to that
            anchor note. If we consider 4*, we can see that that's 2 up from 2*, so it's interval with respect to the
            anchor note would be 2.
        </p>

        <p>
            But the question we really just answered was, which number do we add to 2* to get to 4*, and that number is
            2. In a different way our question was just 2* + x = 4*, which can be rearranged to be x = 4* - 2* which is
            equal to 2.
        </p>

        <p>
            Due to this we have gained a method to determine the interval between any two notes, so given a note X* and
            a note Y*, the interval from X* to Y* is Y* - X*.
        </p>

        <p>
            Though we might ponder the following question, what is the interval from 2* to 0*, based on the above
            examples, it might be easy to say -2, but another way to think about it is that if you add 9 to 2* you would
            get 11*, and since our system of notes repeats (... 9* 10* 11* 0* 1* 2* 3* 4* 5* 6* 7* 8* 9* 10* 11* 0* 1*
            2* ...), then we can see going one more step leads us to 0. So due to that, we can say that the interval
            from 2* to 0* is 10. Since if we add 10 to 2*, we get to 0*.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because of the above, we never have to use negative numbers if we don't want to. So the interval from 9* to
            0* could be thought of 3 instead of -9. So when we talk about intervals we will always consider the positive
            version.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now that we've discussed some of the fundamental properties about anchor intervals, we can discuss how we can 
            determine any anchor interval. Let's start with a specific example, and then come up with the general method.
        </p>

        <p>
            So let's say our anchor note is set as 8* and our note is 6*, then since the interval from 8* to 6* is -2 or 
            10, then 6*'s anchor interval is 10.
        </p>

        <p>
            So given an anchor note of Y* and a note of X*, then we take the positive version of Y* - X* as the anchor interval.
        </p>
