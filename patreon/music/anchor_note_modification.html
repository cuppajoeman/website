        When a song transposes

    <p>
        Anchor note modification is when there is a shift in the underlying the ai collection that is so obvious that we
        should think about it in a new way. One example of this would improvising over a modal tune like "So What",
        let's have a <a href="https://youtu.be/ylXk1LBvIqU?t=52">listen </a> and hear the pattern move up one step.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most of the song is in 2* minor, except for when it changes to 3* minor for a while. Let's first consider our
        standard approach, which is not to change our anchor note.
    </p>

    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Two Options</h2></div>

    <p>
        If that's the case our anchor intervals for the 2* minor part are 0 2 3 5 7 9 10, and the 3* minor part are
        1 3 4 6 8 10 11, when we think like this we can see between the two collections easier, as we know ending on a 4
        would be a good choice for the 3* minor section as it can move to 3 or 5 easily from the 4.
    </p>

    <p>
        If instead we think of them as two separate collections one where we have an interval collection of 0 2 3 5 7 9
        10 anchored on 2* and then one where it's anchored on 3*, then it will be easier for us to use content that we
        created on the 2* on the 3* since the way it's notated will be the same.
    </p>

    <p>
        As you can see thinking in these two different ways will have their own pros and cons. If we keep our anchor
        note as 2* the whole time, then we will be able to see between the chords but then in our notation if we play
        one line on the 2* part and the same line up one step on the 3* part, then the way it's notated would be
        different, on the other hand if we change our anchor note they would be notated the exact same way.
    </p>

    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Changing Anchor Note</h2></div>

    <p>
        Let's say we were playing on the 2* minor part and we play the line 0, 2, 3, 9, 7, 10, 11, 0 and we're holding
        the 0 and then it changes to the 3* minor part, if we decide to change our anchor note than that 0 no longer
        becomes a 0, so what does it become?
    </p>

    <p>
        The way we can answer that question is to think about the note that it represents. So 0 with anchor note of 2*
        represents the note 2*, then if we change our anchor note to be 3*, 2* now becomes 11. All at once we did (2 * +
        0 - 3*) which is the same as (0 - (3* - 2*)) = 0 - I(2*, 3*), so all we have to do to modify the ai is to
        subtract the interval between the two anchor notes.
