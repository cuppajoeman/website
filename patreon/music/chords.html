    <h1 class="text_center">Chords</h1>

    <p>
        Chords are just a collection of notes played at once. Chords can be derived in a variety of different ways, the
        first way we'll discuss is a method of constructing chords from a scale.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's say we were given a 3* major scale. Let's create chords out of each note of the scale and also recall that
        0 2 4 5 7 9 11 are the ai's involved in a major scale. We could choose notes in any way, but for the sake of
        this demonstration we'll do it in a way that creates chords known as triads, in order to do that we will skip
        every second ai.
    </p>

    <table class="center">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Starting ai</th>
            <th>ai's in chord<br></th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>0 4 7 11</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>2 5 9 0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4<br></td>
            <td>4 7 11 2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>5 9 0 4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>7</td>
            <td>7 11 2 5<br></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>9</td>
            <td>9 0 4 7</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>11</td>
            <td>11 2 5 9</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
        Something that we will learn about is that each chord has a quality to it, a quality is defined as
        how the chord sounds, and doesn't change when the whole chord is shifted around as long as the gaps between the
        ai's stay the same.
    </p>

    <p>
        So for example, the two chords 2 5 9 0 and 4 7 11 2 actually have the same quality since the gaps between the
        ai's is 3 4 3 in both chords (2 + 3 = 5, 5 + 4 = 9, 9 + 3 = 0 and 4 + 3 = 7, 7 + 4 = 11, 11 + 3 = 2), but just
        because two chords have the same quality doesn't mean that they have the same effect.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally the way we constructed the chords here is not the only way we could have done it, for example
        another method could have been to start with one ai, take the next one and then skip one, and then skip one
        again. Using this method we could have produced the following chords.
    </p>

    <table class="center">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Starting ai</th>
            <th>ai's in chord<br></th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>0 2 5 9</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>2 4 7 9</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4<br></td>
            <td>4 5 9 0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>5 7 11 2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>7</td>
            <td>7 9 0 4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>9</td>
            <td>9 11 2 5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>11</td>
            <td>11 0 4 7</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
        Or we don't have to define any set of predefined chords and when we're playing we can choose the ai's we'd like
        rather than a predetermined collection associated with each note of the scale.
    </p>

    <p>
        The main thing we need to understand is that the most important information a chord has to offer are what ai's
        are involved in the chord and also what the quality of the chord is. Two chords with the same ai's are similar,
        two chords with the same quality sound similar, when both match they are the same.
    </p>

    <p>
        Over time as we play chords we will be able to choose chords which we enjoy and be able to communicate by using
        chords.
