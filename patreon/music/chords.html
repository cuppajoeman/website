        <h2 class="line_text">What they are and how to Notate</h2></div>

    <p>
        A chord is simply a set of notes played simultaneously.
    </p>

    <p>
        When we are thinking in terms of anchor notation, then we can take these notes and turn them into anchor
        intervals.
    </p>

    <p>
        To make this more concrete let's say that our chord was made out of the notes 2* 6* 9* and that our anchor note
        was 2*, when this is the case then we can re-write our chord using anchor intervals and it ends up looking like
        0 4 7.
    </p>

    <p>
        From here on out when we want to talk about a chord we will have some implied anchor note and then we will write
        our chord using anchor intervals.
    </p>

    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Quality</h2></div>

    <p>
        Something that we will learn about is that each chord has a quality to it, a quality is defined as
        how the chord sounds, and doesn't change when the whole chord is shifted around as long as the gaps between the
        ai's stay the same.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even though the pitch of the chord changes in the above example, the underlying structure of the way produced by
        that chord stays unchanged meaning that it will have a similar effect on the listener.
    </p>

    <p>
        So for example, the two chords 2 5 9 0 and 4 7 11 2 actually have the same quality since the gaps between the
        ai's is 3 4 3 in both chords (2 + 3 = 5, 5 + 4 = 9, 9 + 3 = 0 and 4 + 3 = 7, 7 + 4 = 11, 11 + 3 = 2), but just
        because two chords have the same quality doesn't mean that they have the same effect.
    </p>

    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Duality</h2></div>

    <p>
        Every chord you play is made up a series of anchored intervals and also has a quality to it, these two
        properties are the main factors which determine the sound and effect of a chord. Two chords with the same
        quality but different ai's will sound similar but not the exact same, two chords with the same ai's but
        different quality will sound similar but not the same.
    </p>

    <p>
        Working with the ai and quality duality is a skill you will learn over time which is a skill which is less
        obviously learned using the standard method (it's usually implicity learned).
