    <h1 class="text_center">Guitar in Fourths</h1>

    <p>
        If we tune our guitar in fourths, the open notes of the guitar, from the thickest string to the thinnest
        string will be.
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        E A D G C F
    </p>

    <p>
        In our new notation:
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        4* 9* 2* 7* 0* 5*
    </p>

    <p>
        If you recall from before, a perfect fourth is really a jump by 5, and we can see that reflected in these
        notes, you can start with 4* and keep adding 5 to it to generate these notes:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>4* + 0 = 4*</li>

        <li>4* + 5 = 9*</li>

        <li>9* + 5 = 14* = 2* (note we want the number less than 11)</li>

        <li>2* + 5 = 7*</li>

        <li>7* + 5 = 0* (since 12* is 0*)</li>

        <li>0* + 5 = 5*</li>
    </ul>
