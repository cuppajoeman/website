    <p>
        An efficient way to improve on guitar is to be able to know what ai's you are playing at any moment in time. If
        you are able to do this then you'll be able to control which notes you are playing and avoid mistakes.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, if the context was a D major scale, or in other words the collection of ai's 0 2 4 5 7 9 11 where
        we are anchored to the fretboard by a 0 at fret 5 on string 9*. And our goal was to improvise single notes over
        top of this then by keeping track of the current note's ai that we are playing we would always know whether or
        not we are succeeding at playing notes from that scale.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example if we were playing 5 somewhere on the fretboard, and we moved one string over (towards the
        thinner/higher pitched strings), then we would now be playing a 10, which is not part of the ai's defined by the
        major scale. So this note might sound off.
    </p>

    <p>
        By playing like this we are able to make a connection between our notation and the way things sounds, and over
        time it will give us a way to connect ai's with sounds and allow us to communicate better using the instrument.
