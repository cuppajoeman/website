    <p>
        In this course we will take a different approach to musical notes.
    </p>

    <p>
        To start we'll first go through how we're going to reference notes:
    </p>

    <img class="inverted_image" src="assets/a_new_way_to_think_of_notes/flat_map.png"
         style="width: 100%; height: auto;">

    <p>
        Or around a circle it looks like
    </p>

    <img class="inverted_image" src="assets/a_new_way_to_think_of_notes/circle_map.png"
         style="width: 50%; height: auto;">

    <p>
        Therefore when we want to speak of a D#, we would write 3*. The asterisk denotes that it is referencing the
        actual note that we hear, and not anything else.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since this system is cyclic, that is after 11* we go back to 0*, that we never really have to consider a number
        larger than 11*, since if we were to consider 12* it would just be us back at 0* and 15* would just be us at 3*,
        so throughout this course we will never consider numbers larger than 11.
    </p>


    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Notes Relative to Others</h2></div>

    <p>
        In our approach we will generalize a bit on what exactly a note is. In our new method, we will instead
        think of a note relative to some anchoring note, to make that more clear we will look at an example.
    </p>

    <p>
        If we consider D, its 2 steps away from C. But if we consider D with respect to B, we would
        know that this is a 3 steps up from B. This distance is what we will use to characterize our notes.

    <!--            We will start with the following connection to the standard system:-->
    <!--            <table class="center">-->
    <!--                <thead>-->
    <!--                    <tr>-->
    <!--                        <th>C<br></th>-->
    <!--                        <th>o<br></th>-->
    <!--                        <th>D<br></th>-->
    <!--                        <th>o<br></th>-->
    <!--                        <th>E<br></th>-->
    <!--                        <th>F<br></th>-->
    <!--                        <th>o<br></th>-->
    <!--                        <th>G<br></th>-->
    <!--                        <th>o<br></th>-->
    <!--                        <th>A<br></th>-->
    <!--                        <th>o<br></th>-->
    <!--                        <th>B<br></th>-->
    <!--                        <th>C<br></th>-->
    <!--                    </tr>-->
    <!--                </thead>-->
    <!--                <tbody>-->
    <!--                    <tr>-->
    <!--                        <td>0*<br></td>-->
    <!--                        <td>1*<br></td>-->
    <!--                        <td>2*<br></td>-->
    <!--                        <td>3*<br></td>-->
    <!--                        <td>4*<br></td>-->
    <!--                        <td>5*<br></td>-->
    <!--                        <td>6*<br></td>-->
    <!--                        <td>7*<br></td>-->
    <!--                        <td>8*<br></td>-->
    <!--                        <td>9*<br></td>-->
    <!--                        <td>10*<br></td>-->
    <!--                        <td>11*<br></td>-->
    <!--                        <td>0*<br></td>-->
    <!--                    </tr>-->
    <!--                </tbody>-->
    <!--            </table>-->
    <!--        </p>-->


    <p>
        So let's consider D (2*) and setting our anchor note to be B (11*), we can notice that 2* is 3 steps up from
        11*. And therefore we will denote D/2* as the number 3, the note B (11*) is 0 steps away from itself so that
        would be denoted by 0, we would write F# (6*) as 7, finally A (9*) would be a 10.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now we have a new way of thinking about notes with respect to some anchor note. This idea will let us
        incorporate musical analysis into the way we actually play music, and not have them as two separate studies.
