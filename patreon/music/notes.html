            In this course we will take a different approach to musical notes. In the standard system (the normal way we
            notate music), we write notes with letter names and a note always sounds the same.
        </p>

        <p>
            In our approach we will generalize a little bit on what exactly a note is. In our new method, we will
            instead
            think of a note relative to some anchoring note, to make that more clear we will look at an example.
        </p>

        <p>
            If we consider D, we know that is a major second up from C. But if we consider D with respect to B, we would
            know that this is a minor third up from B, and in one sense we could call this note a D#. Obviously if we
            renamed the notes everything would get a lot more confusing, so instead of doing that, let's come up with a
            new
            notation which is based on numbers.
        </p>

        <p>
            We will start with the following connection to the standard system:
            <table class="center">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>C<br></th>
                        <th>o<br></th>
                        <th>D<br></th>
                        <th>o<br></th>
                        <th>E<br></th>
                        <th>F<br></th>
                        <th>o<br></th>
                        <th>G<br></th>
                        <th>o<br></th>
                        <th>A<br></th>
                        <th>o<br></th>
                        <th>B<br></th>
                        <th>C<br></th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>0*<br></td>
                        <td>1*<br></td>
                        <td>2*<br></td>
                        <td>3*<br></td>
                        <td>4*<br></td>
                        <td>5*<br></td>
                        <td>6*<br></td>
                        <td>7*<br></td>
                        <td>8*<br></td>
                        <td>9*<br></td>
                        <td>10*<br></td>
                        <td>11*<br></td>
                        <td>0*<br></td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </p>

        <p>
            Therefore when we want to speak of a D#, we would write 3*. The asterisk denotes that it is referencing the
            actual note that we hear, and not anything else.
        </p>

        <p>
            We can now revisit our idea of the D against the B. In this case we would set our anchor note as 11*, and with
            respect to 11*, a D would be written as a 3 (note there is no asterisk here), and 11* itself as a 0, just for
            another example we could write F# or rather 6* as 7, finally A/9* would be a 10.
        </p>

        As a final note, since this system is cyclic, that is after 11* we go back to 0*, that we never really have to
        consider a number larger than 11*, since if we were to consider 12* it would just be us back at 0* and 15* would
        just be us at 3*, so throughout this course we will never consider numbers larger than 11.

        Now we have a new way of thinking about notes with respect to some anchor note. This idea will let us
        incorporate musical analysis into the way we actually play music, and not have them as two separate studies.
