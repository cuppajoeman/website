        <h2 class="line_text">Structure</h2></div>

    <p>
        You should understand the general structure of how a jazz tune will go. First the head is played (the main
        melody of the song), it may be repeated depending on the length of the song and then solos are played
        alternating throughout the players usually starting on the instruments which played the head and moving through.
    </p>


    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Tempo</h2></div>

    <p>
        The most important part about playing jazz live is that you'll need to be able to do everything up to tempo, if
        you can't keep up with the speed at which the tune is being played at then things are going to fall apart.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you want to be completely safe and also play for a whole session you should be comfortable playing a tune if
        you've never played it before at tempo, both playing the head and playing the changes.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to successfully pull this off there are a few things you can do, the first is to just practice comping
        along with songs from the real book, this means that if that song is called there will be a high change that you
        already remember some of the structure of that song meaning that you don't have to allocate all your brain power
        to reading off the page.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you get a song which has odd changes or you've never seen the changes before then while comping you should
        try to hit at least 2 notes per chord but hopefully 3, by reducing the amount of brain power you use on
        constructing chords the comping complexity is reduced giving you more time to read.
    </p>


    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Communication</h2></div>

    <p>
        While playing with others it may be hard to talk and play at the same time so there are some common things that
        occur to make sure the song stays on track.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you see someone patting the top of their head it means that they're going back to the start (or head) of the
        song and they either want you to go there as well or just doing it to make sure everyone else is on track with
        them.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are confused as to where you are in a song just remember what key it is in and at least play stuff which
        is diatonic.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are completely lost, make sure not to stop playing if you can't play any notes then at least do something
        rhythmic. Just don't stop playing all of a sudden unless completely necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
        After playing with people get to know them a bit, if you messed up during the performance now's a good time to
        laugh at it and talk about the stuff you did right. By talking to people you'll make connections and be able to
        play more.
    </p>

    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Familiarity</h2></div>

    <p>
        You should also listen to the songs via recordings to get a sense of the vibe of the song, and to hear ideas for
        your solos.
    </p>

    <p>
        Make sure that you can read from the real book and not just something you find online, if you only practice with
        videos or something that aids you in anyway then you should focus on reading from paper which is static as it
        will force you to follow along and recall where you are in the song.
