    <h1 class="text_center">Practice and Self Control</h1>

    <p>
        In the following article we will discuss a few different components which should make up any practice session.
        You should be able to be flexible with these ideas and not be static with the way you practice. For example
        self-analysis can be done at any moment in time and not nessesarily right after you practice.
    </p>


    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Warm-Up</h2></div>

    <p>
        To start off I recommend doing something that you are comfortable with and doesn't push you that hard in any
        aspect. Over time your warm-up will evolve and over time things that you did during your main practice time will
        become warm-up.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, if you're comfortable improvising single notes over a backing track that you find on youtube, then
        that could be your warmup. If you're not at that level yet, then your warmup might be playing notes and calling
        out their anchor intervals at the same time making sure that you are in control of the notes that you are
        playing. If you're more advanced then you could take a jazz standard and improvise chords over it as to
        accompany someone.
    </p>

    <p>
        The main purpose of the warm-up period is that it lets you get ready for doing stuff which is more difficult,
        and is the part of the practice which should feel more enjoyable/fun than the other section, since there is less
        load.
    </p>

    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Improvement</h2></div>

    <p>
        Now that you've done something that you have already warmed up, then the next step is to do work which will
        improve your current skills. The main way to do that is to push yourself on the edge of your ability/comfort
        zone.
    </p>

    <p>
        An example of what this might look like is increasing the tempo at which you practice chord improvisation over
        jazz standards. If you can currently improvise chords over a jazz standard at 65BPM, then your improvement phase
        might be to be able to improvise chords over that standard at 70BPM.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most of the time the improvement phase should make you feel a little bit uncomfortable, like you're trying to
        catch up to someone and their just out of reach or you're just able to keep up with them.
    </p>


    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Self-Analysis</h2></div>

    <p>
        After you're done with the improvement phase there might have been things that you notice about the way that you
        play, for example maybe you noticed that when you're improvising chords over a tune and you turn the tempo up
        too much that you start relying on memorized chord shapes rather than thinking about and constructing chords as
        you go.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you've noticed something like this then you should think about how you can counteract these issues, for
        example if we're dealing with the issue above, then one way we might proceed is to not increase tempos too fast
        or to a level where we have to rely on memorized things since we can't play fast enough.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is the most important part about your practice since it will allow you to move forward more efficiently and
        not practice things which aren't moving us towards our goal.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the most important discoveries I made was after I realized that the speed at which I could construct
        chords was way too slow and that without understanding and internalizing horizontal movement on the fretboard
        that
        I would never be able to build chords fast enough to accompany others.
    </p>

    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Self-Control</h2></div>

    <p>
        Having self-control is one of the most important parts of practice, it's what will allow you to continually make
        improvements and not allow yourself to plateau.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, if you play with backing tracks which aren't very harmonically complex, eg they don't have many
        chord changes and you can get away with improvising using one or two ai collections, then it might be easy to
        feel like you're doing well, but then you might jam with someone on a song which is more complex and realize
        that you weren't ready.
    </p>

    <p>
        What this means is that if you become complacent with the skills that you might not be able to improve and
        become the best player you can be. To counteract this we should always be aware of our faults, biases and things
        that we know we should work on.
    </p>

    <p>
        Being able to have a high level of self-control will also give you more motivation as it will let you achieve
        your goals faster and then be able to enjoy the rewards those bring which causes a positive feedback cycle.
