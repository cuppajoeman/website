        <h2 class="line_text">Intervals</h2></div>

    <p>
        An interval between two numbers is what you have to add to the first to get to the second, in other words:
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        I(X, Y) = Y - X
    </p>

    <p>
        To compute that in the most efficient manner we can reduce the amount of distance we move by using the small
        representation:
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        I(X, Y) = Y - s(X)
    </p>


    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Anchor Intervals</h2></div>

    <p>
        To define an anchor interval you need an anchor note, and an other note, the anchor interval between them is
        simply the interval between the anchor note and the other note.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thus given an anchor note A* and an other note N*, to efficiently determine the interval between them we
        compute:
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        I(A*, N*) = N - s(A)
    </p>

    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Scales</h2></div>

    <p>
        The relative interval collection of a major scale is:
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        0 2 4 5 7 9 11
    </p>

    <p>
        and of the minor:
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        0 2 3 5 7 8 10
    </p>

    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Guitar Tuned in Fourths</h2></div>

    <p>
        The open strings of the guitar are:
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        4* 9* 2* 7* 0* 5*
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that the next note is computed by taking the one on it's left and adding 5, a fourth is an interval of 5
        steps so this is why it's called fourths tuning.
    </p>

    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Finding Notes on the Guitar</h2></div>

    <p>
        Given that you are on string S*, and you are looking for the note N*, the fret at which it can be found is the
        I(S*, N*) which is equal to N - S. This is correct because moving up frets increases your note by one, thus the
        fret number is the number which you are adding to S*.
    </p>

    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Scales on the Guitar</h2></div>

    <p>
        Play scales on the guitar combines all of the previous skills we've built up, by remembering the tuning of the
        instrument, we know that by staying on the same fret but moving horizontally over by one string (towards thinner
        strings) will increase our note by 5, so as we move through the relative interval collection we can also move
        horizontally across the fretboard instead of just staying on one string.
