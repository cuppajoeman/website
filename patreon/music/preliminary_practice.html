    <p>
        If you already have experience with music then start by practicing converting a note into it's corresponding
        number, so if you saw an Ab you would really think 8*.
    </p>

    <p>
        Start getting faster at figuring out what anchor interval a note has with respect to the standard system, to get
        fast use the "anchor interval trainer" web app.
    </p>

    <p>
        Start learning what the anchor interval collections of the main scales are and how to play them on the neck of
        the guitar. In order to do that you'll first need to find the root of that scale somewhere on the guitar, and to
        do that you'll practice finding a single note all over the fretboard.
