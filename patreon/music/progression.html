        <h2 class="line_text">Tempo</h2></div>

    <p>
        While you are learning how to improvise chords, at the beginning you will find it quite challenging and the
        speed at which you may be able to do stuff may be discouraging.
    </p>

    <p>
        A comforting thing to remember is that there is always a tempo where you can do whatever you are working on,
        that tempo might be extremely slow, but the fact that such a tempo exists should allow you Ground yourself to a
        sense of progression.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's say that you were able to determine that you can improvise chords which outline the changes of a backing
        track or a tune your working on at 20BPM. At such a low speed you might find that it's hard to retain your
        focus, and connect to the song.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even though this might be true, each time you play you will get slightly better/faster. Past just practicing
        there are other things which will allow you to increase the tempo at which you can play.
    </p>

    <p>
        As with everything we've done so far, the only way to improve what we are doing is by an analysis of our current
        processes.
    </p>

    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Analysis of the Process</h2></div>

    <p>
        We will break down the process of improvising chords over a tune. A common chord progression is "Dmin7 -> G7 ->
        Cmaj7" and for simplicity sake let's assume that the underlying structure is C major. Note that we're writing it
        with respect to the standard notation, because this is most likely what you'll see in a tune.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a beginner, we might still be learning about how we can convert these standard chord symbols into anchor
        intervals. If you're at this stage in the learning process then you'll recognize that since the key is 0* major,
        that the notes's number is actually the anchor interval itself, this makes 0* the fastest key to play in, but
        with time all keys will become equally as fast.
    </p>

    <p>
        So we see the Dmin7, so our first step is see that our root anchor interval is 2, and that to construct the
        other anchor intervals we have to use 0 3 7 10 as our relative interval template, so our anchor intervals become
        2 5 9 0, a similar process for the G7 gives us 7 11 2 5, and the Cmaj7 is 0 4 7 11.
    </p>

    <p>
        So this process might take you some time when you first do it, but as time progresses and you continue to work
        on this then this will be second nature, and just as you're able to add 3 to 4 and tell me that it's 7 almost
        instantly, you will be able to add 7 and 8 and tell me that that's 3 instantly in our system over time.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a more intermediate player you might be able to make this conversion quite quickly, and so your main focus
        would be on how you build this chord on the instrument, so you see the 2 5 9 0, and you have a finger on the 9
        on the 0* string, you know that the following is true X 6 X X 9 X since moving 3 <- subtracts 3 from our current
        ai, then you can make a simple vertical adjustment to grab a 5 instead of the 6, then you also consider that 1 X
        X X 9 X is true, and also make a similar vertical adjustment, finally we can see that X X X X 9 2 holds as well,
        thus giving us a full voicing of 2 5 9 0 being improvised across the fretboard. When the next chord comes by we
        know what anchored intervals are sitting under our fingers and we're able to modify our current chord in
        combination with a bit of horizontal movement to get to our 7 11 2 5, finally the same process is preformed on
        the 0 4 7 11.
    </p>

    <p>
        As an advanced player conversion from standard chord notation into anchor intervals doesn't pose any timing
        issues and extensions can be added easily, improvisation of the chord on the board is not a time consuming
        process either and so after the main chord is played, during that chords time you are also able to improvise
        melodies on top of the chords or just add interest by not just playing the full chord once. On top of that you
        are able to also consider the next few chords that are coming up during the time that was allocated for the
        current chord, thus allowing you to move with ease and get into more of a flow. In the advanced comping with
        someone keeps your thoughts heightened to the level of a solo even though you're soloing.
    </p>

    <p>
        After thinking about how the progression of chord improvisation looks like at 3 different levels it gives us
        some insight on how we can move between the levels easier and improve.
    </p>

    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Breaking it Down</h2></div>

    <p>
        The first thing to note is that there are 2 main steps involved in chord improvisation, the first being
        conversion from standard chord notation into an anchored interval collection, and the second being the
        construction of the chord on the board. In order to reduce the overall time of the whole process we may minimize
        the time for each of the two smaller processes.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to reduce the amount of time it takes for you to convert standard notation into anchored interval
        notation, there are a few different things we can do, the first is a passive memorization of the tunes changes
        by playing the tune multiple times, by playing the tune multiple times it allows us to enjoy the process of
        learning the tune rather than actually sitting down and trying to memorize it in a vacuum, additionally it
        allows us to build connections between sounds and our notation. Another thing we can do is just train the
        translations in a sort of vacuum, which in itself is less fun but will allow you to speed up which will be fun.
    </p>

    <p>
        The way we will train our translation is by using the web application that was specifically built for this
        process, the way this application works is that it first defines an anchor note, say Ab (8*) and then throws us
        a chord, say Emin7 and asks us for the the anchor intervals that this defines, as you might already know the
        process goes like this, determine the anchor interval of the root of the chord we are trying to find, and then
        use the relative interval template defined by the chord to determine what the anchor intervals are.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since E is 4*, then the anchor interval of E is 8, then we apply the relative interval template which is 0 3 7
        10 which yields 8 11 3 6 after we've solved the question in our head we type in those anchor intervals into the
        computer and it verifies if it's correct and then moves onto the next one.
    </p>

    <p>
        The reason why this type of training is useful is that it covers all the possible chords you will ever see while
        your playing so that you will never be stuck or surprised while you're playing.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now that we've covered methods of improving the first component of chord improvisation, we'll move onto
        optimizing the second half, which is the fretboard construction phase. In order to become fast at this, we
        simply need to have really good horizontal movement, so in other words given some anchor interval, we have the
        ability to figure out other ai's on this line with ease.
    </p>

    <p>
        The larger the horizontal distances you can work with the easier you will be able to construct chords and so
        being free in this sense will grant you the ability to construct chords quickly. When you are starting your
        journey with this process you'll probably only be able to consider the distances which are 1 away from your
        current horizontal position, but through sentient practice where you focus on making larger gaps like horizontal
        distances of 2 or 3 then you will reap many rewards.
    </p>

    <p>
        On top of this type of practice we've also built another web application which helps train this horizontal
        movement. The way this application works is that it shows you a horizontal line across the fretboard which is
        covered by undiscovered horizontal ai's represented by X's, aside from two positions one of which there is an
        ai, and the other being a highlighted X.
    </p>

    <p>
        The highlighted position represents a prompt for the user to fill in what that positions ai would be with
        respect to the ai' which is numbered, after the user fills this prompt with the correct ai and presses the space
        bar then a new situation is created and the process continues.
    </p>

    <p>
        By using these applications to train the two fundamental aspects of chord improvisation you should start to see
        increases in speed of your improvisation allowing you to play interesting ideas and create music which people
        will want to listen to.
