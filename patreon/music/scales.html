<div class="thin_wrapper">
    <h1 class="text_center">Scales</h1>
    <p>
        With the major scale you might know the standard way we construct it, which is by taking some root note and then
        following the following pattern.
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        W W H W W W H
    </p>

    <p>
        Where W stands as a Whole Tone and H stands as a Half Tone. So starting on C, we get the following notes:
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        C D E F G A B C
    </p>

    <p>
        Another way to write this could be in line with our previous system so we can take our W H pattern and write it
        as
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        2 2 1 2 2 2 1
    </p>

    <p>
        Then instead of taking jumps with respect to the previous note, we could consider them with respect to the root
        of the scale and get these intervals:
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        0 2 4 5 7 9 11 0
    </p>

    <p>
        So if we were to make an F major scale, then we would take 5* (F) and generate the following notes from it
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>5* + 0 = 5* (F)</li>

        <li>5* + 2 = 7* (G)</li>

        <li>5* + 4 = 9* (A)</li>

        <li>5* + 5 = 10* (Bb)</li>

        <li>5* + 7 = 0* (C)</li>

        <li>5* + 9 = 2* (D)</li>

        <li>5* + 11 = 4* (E)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If we consider the minor scale, we have this pattern
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        W H W W H W W
    </p>

    <p>
        In terms of numbers, that is
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        2 1 2 2 1 2 2
    </p>

    <p>
        And with respect to the root note
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        0 2 3 5 7 8 10 0
    </p>
