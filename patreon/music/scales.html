    <h1 class="text_center">Scales</h1>

    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Major</h2></div>

    <p>
        With the major scale you might know the standard way we construct it, which is by taking some root note and then
        following the following pattern. Once done we call the collections.
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        W W H W W W H
    </p>

    <p>
        Where W stands as a Whole Tone and H stands as a Half Tone. So starting on C, we get the following notes:
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        C D E F G A B C
    </p>

    <p>
        Another way to write this could be in line with our previous system so we can take our W H pattern and write it
        as
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        2 2 1 2 2 2 1
    </p>

    <p>
        Then instead of taking jumps with respect to the previous note, we could consider them with respect to the root
        of the scale and get these intervals:
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        0 2 4 5 7 9 11 0
    </p>

    <p>
        So if we were to make an F major scale, then we would take 5* (F) and generate the following notes from it
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>5* + 0 = 5* (F)</li>

        <li>5* + 2 = 7* (G)</li>

        <li>5* + 4 = 9* (A)</li>

        <li>5* + 5 = 10* (Bb)</li>

        <li>5* + 7 = 0* (C)</li>

        <li>5* + 9 = 2* (D)</li>

        <li>5* + 11 = 4* (E)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Due to how we are adding these numbers relative to the root tone which in this case is 5*, then we can call this
        collection of intervals (0 2 4 5 7 9 11) a relative interval collection or ric for short.
    </p>

    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Minor</h2></div>

    <p>
        If we consider the minor scale, we have this pattern
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        W H W W H W W
    </p>

    <p>
        In terms of numbers, that is
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        2 1 2 2 1 2 2
    </p>

    <p>
        And with respect to the root note, the relative interval collection is
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        0 2 3 5 7 8 10 0
    </p>

    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Relative Major/Minor</h2></div>

    <p>
        Something that's interesting to note is that a minor and major scale can define the same set of notes as each
        other. The canonical example is that of 0* major and 9* minor, where the 0* major generates the notes 0* 2* 4*
        5* 7* 9* 11*, and the 9* minor defines the note collection of 9* 11* 0* 2* 4* 5* 7* which are both the same.
    </p>

    <p>
        In general, what that's saying is that given some note x*, that x* major is the same as (x-3)* minor, which can
        be seen in generality as:
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        Major: (x + 0)*, (x + 2)*, (x + 4)*, (x + 5)*, (x + 7)*, (x + 9)*, (x + 11)*
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        Minor: (x - 3 + 0)*, (x - 3 + 2)*, (x - 3 + 3)*, (x - 3 + 5)*, (x - 3 + 7)*, (x - 3 + 8)*, (x - 3 + 10)*
    </p>

    <p>
        Which simplifies down to
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        (x + 9)*, (x + 11)*, (x + 0)*, (x + 2)*, (x + 4)*, (x + 5)*, (x + 7)*
    </p>

    <p>
        When re-arranged yields:
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        (x + 0)*, (x + 2)*, (x + 4)*, (x + 5)*, (x + 7)*, (x + 9)*, (x + 11)*
    </p>

    <p>
        Thus it is now clear as to why these two relative interval collections which differ can generate a set of notes
        which do not differ.
    </p>

    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Generalizing Relativity</h2></div>

    <p>
        We will end this discussion by taking the result into even more generality, we can further see that the relative
        interval collection for a minor key is the same relative interval collection as the major, but with 3 added
        everywhere. Consider:
    </p>

    <p class="text_center">
        (Major + 3) = 0 + 3, 2 + 3, 4 + 3, 5 + 3, 7 + 3, 9 + 3, 11 + 3 = 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 0, 2, = 0 2 3 5 7 8 10 (Minor)
    </p>

    <p>
        Then it should be arithmetically clear that if we start a minor relative interval collection on the note (x -
        3)*, then it then it would construct the same notes as the x* major since every +3 would be cancelled by the -3
        when added during the note generation process.
    </p>

    <p>
        So the most general result here is that if you take a relative interval collection and then add n to everyone of
        it's intervals, and then generate notes from that modified ric from the note (x - n)*, then that generates the
        same set of notes as using the original ric generating from x*, as the -n's and the +n's will cancel in the
        generation process.
