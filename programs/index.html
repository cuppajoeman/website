      <p>
          Here are programs that I have created
      </p>
      <h1>music</h1>
      <h2>anchor keyboard</h2>
      <p>
          A virtual software instrument that has a nice visualizer and sane keybindings
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>status: stable</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>x11 keyboard generator</h2>
      <p>
          This program lets you generate new keyboard configurations with ease just by creating layouts in textfiles.
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>status: stable</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>web</h1>
      <h2>permalinked website</h2>
      <p>
          A script which allows you to maintain a website using a hierarchy structure while also being able to access pages through permalinks that know nothing of the hierarchy structure. The point of this program is to help maintain a website or hosted data that you want to exist for a long time and always have working links.
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>status: stable</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>fsweb</h2>
      <p>
          A script which generates html to support the viewing of a regular filesystem on the web
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>status: early stage development</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>interactive</h2>
      <h2><a href="https://github.com/cuppajoeman/cube">cube</a></h2>
      <p>
          A game which allows you to interact with a rubicks cube. The point of the program is to be used for people who are interested in least solve moves and can be extended to view various properties of the cube while solving.
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>status: stable</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a href="https://github.com/cuppajoeman/fractals">mandelbrot</a></h2>
      <ul>
          A mandlebrot viewer able to generate still frames of the mandlebrot set in decent times, can be extended to support other types of two dimensional fractals.
      </ul>
      <ul>
          <li>status: stable</li>
      </ul>
