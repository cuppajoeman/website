This site now uses eleventy to make the blog section easier to maintain, see: https://www.11ty.dev/.

Make sure you have `npm` installed, then to run the site for development use:
```
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```
in the root dir.

I am also using highlight.js for syntax highlighting.

For my own personal local files, I recommend creating a projects directiroy in the root of the file system and then setting the homepage to:

```
/home/cc/projects/website/toolbox/personal-homepage/index.html
```

For vim configuration (.vimrc), source files from the following directory:
```
/projects/website/toolbox/vim
```
